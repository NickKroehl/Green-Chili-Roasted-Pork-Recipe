Simply season the pork roast with salt and pepper. Place in a large Dutch oven, cover and roast in a 350 degree oven until done. About 3 hours. Remove the roast from the pan and let cool and then shred the meat with two forks. Set aside.

Heat the oil and the bacon drippings in the same Dutch oven. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 10 minutes . Add the garlic and cook until fragrant.

Add the shredded meat, tomatoes, chicken broth, salt, coriander, cumin, oregano, tomatoes, chile powders, and chiles. Bring to a boil and then simmer on low for 2 hours.

**Optional:** In a bowl, combine water and cornstarch and stir until combined. Add a little of this to thicken the soup, if desired.

Add a squeeze of lime to each bowl of chili. From here, taste and adjust the seasonings to your taste. Serve with warm flour tortillas.
